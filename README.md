# Maximum-Ratio-Kolmogorov-Inspired-Compression-Algorithm

### This code implements a custom compression algorithm that effectively reduces the size of text and JSON files by identifying and replacing repetitive patterns and using advanced encoding techniques. Additionally, it includes functionality for compressing images, optimizing their file size while maintaining quality, and allows users to upload files, view compression metrics, and download the compressed outputs.
